    <!-- Bloakc elements- they take all the horizontal space, despite being them too small. Another element will always start in new line. They have their own margins and paddings. Eg: div, heading tags, p, li, ul, etc. So their default display property is block. -->
    <!-- Inlne elements - They take only as much space as it is required for them. Size setting can be quite hard here.Eg : span, a, button, etc Their default display property is inline.  -->
