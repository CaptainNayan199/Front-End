    <!-- For each is a method for array iteration, often preferred for readability -->
    <!-- Parameters for forEach - one for item, optional for second index. -->
    <!-- Using return is similar to continue in traditional loops. -->
    <!-- Not straightforward to break out of a forEach loop -->
    <!-- When we need to perform an action on each array element and dont need to break early. -->

    <script>
      let names = ["Ujjwal", "Kishan", "Rahul", "Sandesh", "Tommy"];

      //Using normal loop :

      // for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
      //  console.log(names[i]);
      // }

      // Using foreach loop

      names.forEach((names) => console.log(names));

      let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
      numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(`Square of ${num} is ${num * num}`));

      //Where forEach is not to use : if there is a need to break, we can't because forEach works on a straight pattern. Works exactly like a continue for any condition(found condition? skip that and move to the next.)
