// Auto boxing - automatic conversion of primitives to an object.

let namee = 'Nayan'
console.log(namee.toUpperCase());
console.log(namee.length);

// So here, string namee is a primitive type in js, but we have converted it to an object and then applied all different methods available, this is what auto-boxing means.
