// What are variables ? -> Variables are the container where something(values in our case) is stored. Variables are relevant and appropriate containe to store variables.

var name = 'Sita'
var age = 20
var isMarried = false

// So here in the above few lines name, age and isMarried are variables/containers.
// The best way to define variable is using let(most common). Var is global scope and let is block scope.

let myName = "Nayan"
console.log(myName)

// Variables cannot be named as reserved keywords, cannot be started with numbers, no other special character other than $ and _.

// Updating values

let myAge = 20

myAge = myAge + 1 //21
myAge -= 1 // this is equal to -> myAge = myAge - 1 = 20
myAge += 1 //21
myAge /= 1 //21
myAge *= 2 //42
myAge++ // 43
