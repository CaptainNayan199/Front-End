// Strings are alphabetical values, characters wrapped inside single/double quotes or backticks.
name = "Nayan"

`

// Strings holds textual data, anything from a single character to paragraph.

// Concatenation - Combining two or more than two strings.

console.log(name + " is a good person.")
console.log('4'+'5') //45 will be the output as we are adding string 4 and string 5 hence js concatenates it.
