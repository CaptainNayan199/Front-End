What will we be covering in this chapter?
1. IDE Setup
2. Create a React App
3. Project Structure

IDE - It is an Integrated Development Environment, a software suite that consolidates basic tolls required for software development.
It is a central hub for coding, finding problems, testing.
It is designed to improve developer efficiency.
It simplifies complex tasks.
It offers a unified workspace.
IDE features :
  1. COde autocompletion
  2. Syntax highlighting
  3. Version control
  4. Error checking

Process: 
1. Install node (to make a small light server), IDE(VS Code)
2. Create new react project


How to create a react project?
1. Using CRA(Create React App)
2. Vite : a modern tool to create react project. It produces quick and small bundle size. To run the server, use `npm run dev`
3. Use `npm start` for CRA

#Process:
1. npm create vite@latest
2. Give project name.
3. Choose and follow the options accordingly.
4. cd project_name
5. npm install (for all the packages)
6. npm run dev - to run the project

******************Project structure:*********************** 

1. node_modules - this folder has all the installed node packages. It is created after `npm install` command. This can be huge, and never to be deleted or edited & uploaded to github. If mistakely deleted, then again run `npm install`.

2. public - contains all the static files that doesn't change. Files here are served as-is. The index.html is generally kept under this foler.

3. src(the major folder) : This is the main folder for the react code. This is where we write our react code. It usually contains main.jsx(entry point), app.jsx(root component), pages, hooks, styles, etc. 90% of our work happens here.

  i. App.jsx - It is the main react component. This file is called by main.jsx.
  ii. App.css - styles only related to App component(usually). Needs to be imported inside App.jsx
  iii. index.css - global css, used for body styles, reset css, fonts, theme colors. Imported in the main.jsx

  iv. main.jsx - the entry point - this is where react starts.
  
  a. components - contains the reusable parts of the UI, like buttons or headers. It is just a function that returns a UI.
  b. assets - contains images, fonts, or other static files.
  c. styles - contains CSS or other stylesheets.

4 .gitignore - Tells Git what NOT to track, includes node_modules, .env.

5. eslint.config.js - linting rules, helps catch bugs and bad practices. Optional but good for clean code

6. index.html - the single HTML file, react mounts into this. Has a div whose id is root. So later, react injects everythin inside this div.

7. package-lock.json - locks exact dependecy versions, ensures same install on every machine. Whenever we run `npm run dev` two files are created; package-lock and node modules.

8. package.json - This file stores project names, dependencies, scripts, etc. When we run `npm run dev` - everything comes from here. This is the meta data of our project.

9. README.md - Project documentation, instructions for running the app, userful for github.

10. vite.config.js - vite configuration file, controls plugins, aliases, build settings, etc.
